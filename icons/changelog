CHANGELOG

Sept-14-2003
Update Noia 1.00
The final update. Well, maybe not, but it means this is complete. There's not icons for all K applications, and it's not KDE 3.2 fully compatible; maybe it will be new updates for further KDE versions.
-Added icons for these daily use apps: Kget, Kmail, Ark, K3b
-An important change: now it's under LGPL; previously was under GPL, and changed because the LPGL it's more permissive (requested by some KDE dev, and suggested by some Gnome users too).

Jan-01-2003
Update Noia 0.95
This update is the definitive. I only will fix important bugs. Note: more icons will be released in separate downloads.
-Added the 128x128 size. Not all icons are in this size.
-Added KDE 3.1 icons, such tab icons, kget, messagebox, ...
-Added the throbber.
-Fixed important icons, previously released but missing on last update (such filesave, www)
-Small fixes.
-The Readme text file is more complete. Now have howto's, links to other Noia icons/skins and the complete iconlist.

Nov-23-2002
Update Noia 0.90
This will be the first appointment to a definitive version. Changes:
-The most important: now the Noia icons for KDE are under the GPL license :)
Added 5 icons for these applications:
-kdevelop
-openoffice
-phoenix
-quanta
-xkill
Refined, polished and redesigned 123 icons, the most important are:
-kmail
-konqueror
-xmms
-all icons with internet globe
-all icons with 'shell' (added the 'shell' to console)
-all icons that means application/make/gear now have the 'gear' design. The gear design is new, more according to classical KDE gear.
-some actions now have different color
Added the 48x48 pixels size for 'action' (by request)
Planning about future releases: 
I will not make new icons for this iconset (only the missing KDE 3.1 icons).
The next version will be (i hope) the release candidate and will have the KDE 3.1 missing icons.
Search for other Noia icon sets for more Noia-related icons.

Nov-16-2002
Update Noia 0.50
This is a release with lots of new icons. New additions in:
-Actions=27 new icons
-Mimetypes=9 new icons
-Filesystems=1 new icon
-Apps=105 new icons
Totally 142 new icons added
No new icons will be added (except if there's a important KDE icon missing)
Now it's time to change some bad designed icons and fix small sizes.
The next release will be the Release Candidate, and the lastest before the final release.
Extra icons will be released apart.

Nov-13-2002
Update Noia 0.11
There's no updates on graphics and on aditions or substractions to icons, only two small but important fixes:
-A issue with 48x48 icon sizes
-Deleted some unnecessary files 'thumbs.db' created by 'other' filemanagers apart of KDE Konqueror.
Now the download file is really low than the first versions ;) This will allow me to add the necessary icons without being worred about the download size.
Carlitus

Nov-12-2002
Update Noia 0.10
First important bug fixes:
-Added the missing 22x22 and 48x48 sizes (initially unreleased to no increase the download size)
-Eliminated the 128x128 size. Don't panic, this size will be released as a enhancement. I decided this to decrease the download size (very high).
-Added the 'inherit' command in the configuration. Now the Noia icon set will be showed with your default icon set.
There's no changes on the designs. The purpose of this update is just to structure correctly the icon set, and to create the correct text files for your information :)
